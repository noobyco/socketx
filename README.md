# Socketx

It is a room-based chat application built using Javascript in backend. For real-time communication reason i have not utilized http/https protocols, instead used websocket protocol with a wrapper library [Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).

<br>

Socketx is deployed and ready to use at - [socketx-production.up.railway.app](https://socketx-production.up.railway.app/)
